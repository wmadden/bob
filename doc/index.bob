    - H2: What is Bob?
      
    - Text:
        - Bob is an abstraction layer above document markup (aimed at HTML/CSS, but
          implementation independent).
        - For example, <a href="index.bob">this code</a> produced this document.
    
    - H2: Bob's Goals
    
    - NumberedList:
        - > Content-orientation: we should be describing content, not the 
            structure used to display it
          
        - > Human-readability: it should be easy for a human to write documents, 
            and hence easy to maintain them
          
        - > Implementation independence: since we're content-oriented, it should 
            be possible to output HAML, or XML, or plain-text instead of hardwired XHTML
          
        - > Extensibility: it should be possible to easily extend the solution to 
            handle new behaviour, as it is required
