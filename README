Welcome to Bob.

Bob is an abstraction of general document definition and display markup whereby
simple patterns of structured content can be created, mixed and reused.

Project Goals:
  1. Content-orientation: we should be describing content, not the structure used
     to display it
  2. Human-readability: it should be easy for a human to write documents, and
     hence easy to maintain them
  3. Implementation independence: since we're content-oriented, it should be
     possible to output HAML, or XML, or plain-text instead of hardwired XHTML
  4. Extensibility: it should be possible to easily extend the solution to
     handle new behaviour, as it is required

For Users:
  Bob works by interpreting document definitions in YAML, for example

    Form:
        - Control:
            name: name
        - Control:
            name: age
        - Control:
            name: gender
            type: select
            options:
              - male
              - female

Each camelcase node indicates a "component" - an abstract part of the document,
usually with a specific purpose, and which displays in a unique way. In the
above example, the "Form" and "Control" nodes indicate components, the rest of
the information describes those components.

More information is available on the Bob website (or will be soon),

For Developers:
  Documentation is coming, but for now the comments in the source should be
enough.
